# Minor Arduino Projects

In this project i used arduino uno r3, which is a popular micro controller to build some daily life useful projects. Along with arduino there are other hardware devices in each project.
In this project i used tinkercad to make circuits.

## List of projects
**1) Traffic lights controlling system ** 
**2) Anti Theft System ** 
**3) Smart home appliances ** 

## Traffic lights controlling system

**Components used:**
| Components     | Usage         |
| -------------  | ------------- |
| Arduino UNO R3 | microconroller|
| PIR sensor     | (passive infrared sensor) detects the motion of objects |
| Piezo          | Buzzer - when sensor detect a movement it will produce a sound |
