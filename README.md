# Minor Arduino Projects

In these projects, I used the Arduino Uno R3, a popular microcontroller, to create practical devices for everyday life. Each project includes various hardware components alongside the Arduino, and I designed the circuits using Tinkercad.


## List of projects

**1) Traffic lights controlling system** 

**2) Anti Theft System** 

**3) Smart home appliances** 


## Traffic lights controlling system

**Components used:**

| Components       | Usage         |
| -------------    | ------------- |
| Arduino UNO R3   | microconroller|
| Red LEDS's x 3   | stopping vehicles |
| Yellow LED's x 3 | waiting |
| Green LED's x 3  | start moving  |

**How It Works:**

The system consists of a total of 9 LEDs, which are used to create a three-sided traffic light setup. The operation is straightforward: when the green light is illuminated on one side, the red light should be lit on the other sides.

## Anti-theft System

**Components used:**

| Components     | Usage         |
| -------------  | ------------- |
| Arduino UNO R3 | microconroller|
| PIR sensor     | (passive infrared sensor) detects the motion of objects |
| Piezo          | Buzzer - when sensor detect a movement it will produce a sound |

**How It Works:**

Imagine having a small security system that watches over your belongings. Here's how this project operates:

1)The Secret Sensor: The PIR sensor acts like a tiny observer, spotting any movements nearby. It has three pins: GND, POWER, and SIGNAL.

2)Sensing Motion: Whenever something moves within the sensor's view, it sends a special signal to the Arduino.

3)Buzzer's Voice: The Piezo Buzzer is similar to a mini-speaker. When the Arduino gets the signal that motion has been detected, it tells the Piezo Buzzer to create a sound.

4)Buzzer Alert: If anyone tries to sneak around and the sensor notices them, the buzzer makes a noise like saying, "Hey, I noticed you!"

## Smart Home appliances

**Components used:**

| Components     | Usage         |
| -------------  | ------------- |
| Arduino UNO R3 | microconroller|
| PIR sensor     | (passive infrared sensor) detects the motion of person |
| Light Bulb     | Whenever a person is in the range of sensor bulb will lit up |
| Power Supply   | electronic test equipment for supplying power to circuit |
| Relay SPDT     | A powerful SPDT which is used to control flow of power like a switch |


**How It Works:**
 
Here's how this project operates:

1)The Secret Sensor: The PIR sensor acts like a tiny observer, spotting any movements nearby. It has three pins: GND, POWER, and SIGNAL.

2)Sensing Motion: Whenever a person comes into sensors view then the signal pin will send information to arduino, telling that there is person.

3)Electric bulb: Bulb connected to arduino through relay and powersupply, it will function according to the signal generated by the sensor.
